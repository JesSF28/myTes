Hon. J. 3. Leslie, District Attorney,
McAllen, Texas,
uy deer ur. leslie:-
The bearer of this letter has been in to see

we about her troubles with her husband and I learn from diffreent
sounpes that she is a very deserving womem and thet her husband
has mistreated her very bedly . 4s he never lived with her in
this County i hardly think that we would have jurisdiction dom
here and 1 know thet this is a matter within the "purview " of the
duties of the County Attirney but es she is a verg poor woman | told
her to call on you and you would recommend the proper J. P. for her
to go and make complaint if necessary end then o f course ur,
Montgonery can be notified. Guess helping in this kind of cases
is port of the liabilities of public Honpps . I do an immense
enount of that kind of work here.

Call on me at any time that 1 can be of service to you.

Yours trv.
